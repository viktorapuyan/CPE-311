        "1. For solving the tower of hanoi problem, I used recursion wherein as the user inputs n number of disks greater than 0 let's say 2, what it does is that it moves n-1 disks from source to aux. For example, if I have 2 disks, 1st disk will be moved, one going from source to aux and the larger disk or the nth disk is going from source to destination. After that the disk from the aux will go to the destination rod and it ends the program.\n",
        "2. The recursion in the program is whenever let's say we have 2 disks and when the program reads that the n number of disks is greater than 0 let's say 2, it keeps on subtracting 1 and goes back to calling the function again until it satisfies the condition and then prints the steps of the movement of the disks."
